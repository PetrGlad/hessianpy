* Transparent exception handling across remote call would be desirable 
(translate or reformat returned error message into usual Python stack trace).

* Implement simple way of specifying Hessian type to be serialized.
Now it is very tricky to make the library to send XML or Binary.
Binary types probably should be handled as streams.

* Speed up UTF8 conversions (can we use standard encoders for that?).

* Use distutils for distribution as there are many files now.
