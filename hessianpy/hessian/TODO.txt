1. Transparent exception handling across remote call would be desirable 
(translate or reformat returned error message into usual Python stack trace)

2. Try using urllib2 instead of hand-crafted transport support 
and see what happens (code complexity, compatibility, performance etc.)

3. Use distutils for distribution as there is many files now
