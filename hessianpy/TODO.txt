    TODO

* Binary types should be handled as streams.

    NICE TO HAVE

* Implement simple way of specifying Hessian type to be serialized.
Now it is very tricky to make the library to send XML or Binary.

* Transparent exception handling across remote call would be desirable 
(translate or reformat returned error message into usual Python stack trace).
